[`cacache`](https://github.com/npm/cacache) is a Node.js library for managing
local key and content address caches. It's really fast, really good at
concurrency, and it will never give you corrupted data, even if cache files
get corrupted or manipulated.

On systems that support user and group settings on files, cacache will
match the `uid` and `gid` values to the folder where the cache lives, even
when running as `root`.

It was written to be used as [npm](https://npm.im)'s local cache, but can
just as easily be used on its own.

## Install

`$ npm install --save cacache`

### Example

```javascript
const cacache = require('cacache')
const fs = require('fs')

const tarball = '/path/to/mytar.tgz'
const cachePath = '/tmp/my-toy-cache'
const key = 'my-unique-key-1234'

// Cache it! Use `cachePath` as the root of the content cache
cacache.put(cachePath, key, '10293801983029384').then(integrity => {
  console.log(`Saved content to ${cachePath}.`)
})

const destination = '/tmp/mytar.tgz'

// Copy the contents out of the cache and into their destination!
// But this time, use stream instead!
cacache.get.stream(
  cachePath, key
).pipe(
  fs.createWriteStream(destination)
).on('finish', () => {
  console.log('done extracting!')
})

// The same thing, but skip the key index.
cacache.get.byDigest(cachePath, integrityHash).then(data => {
  fs.writeFile(destination, data, err => {
    console.log('tarball data fetched based on its sha512sum and written out!')
  })
})
```

### Features

* Extraction by key or by content address (shasum, etc)
* [Subresource Integrity](#integrity) web standard support
* Multi-hash support - safely host sha1, sha512, etc, in a single cache
* Automatic content deduplication
* Fault tolerance (immune to corruption, partial writes, process races, etc)
* Consistency guarantees on read and write (full data verification)
* Lockless, high-concurrency cache access
* Streaming support
* Promise support
* Fast -- sub-millisecond reads and writes including verification
* Arbitrary metadata storage
* Garbage collection and additional offline verification
* Thorough test coverage
* There's probably a bloom filter in there somewhere. Those are cool, right? ðŸ¤”

### API

#### <a name="ls"></a> `> cacache.ls(cache) -> Promise<Object>`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object. Each
entry in the object will be keyed by the unique index key, with corresponding
[`get.info`](#get-info) objects as the values.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.ls(cachePath).then(console.log)
// Output
{
  'my-thing': {
    key: 'my-thing',
    integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64/EnCoDED+HAsh=='
    path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef', // joined with `cachePath`
    time: 12345698490,
    size: 4023948,
    metadata: {
      name: 'blah',
      version: '1.2.3',
      description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
    }
  },
  'other-thing': {
    key: 'other-thing',
    integrity: 'sha1-ANothER+hasH=',
    path: '.testcache/content/bada55',
    time: 11992309289,
    size: 111112
  }
}
```

#### <a name="ls-stream"></a> `> cacache.ls.stream(cache) -> Readable`

Lists info for all entries currently in the cache as a single large object.

This works just like [`ls`](#ls), except [`get.info`](#get-info) entries are
returned as `'data'` events on the returned stream.

##### Example

```javascript
cacache.ls.stream(cachePath).on('data', console.log)
// Output
{
  key: 'my-thing',
  integrity: 'sha512-BaSe64HaSh',
  path: '.testcache/content/deadbeef', // joined with `cachePath`
  time: 12345698490,
  size: 13423,
  metadata: {
    name: 'blah',
    version: '1.2.3',
    description: 'this was once a package but now it is my-thing'
  }
}

{
  key: 'other-thing',
  integrity: 'whirlpool-WoWSoMuchSupport',
  path: '.testcache/content/bada55',
  time: 11992309289,
  size: 498023984029
}

{
  ...
}
```

#### <a name="get-data"></a> `> cacache.get(cache, key, [opts]) -> Promise({data, metadata, integrity})`

Returns an object with the cached data, digest, and metadata identified by
`key`. The `data` property of this object will be a `Buffer` instance that
presumably holds some data that means something to you. I'm sure you know what
to do with it! cacache just won't care.

`integrity` is a [Subresource
Integrity](#integrity)
string. That is, a string that can be used to verify `data`, which looks like
`<hash-algorithm>-<base64-integrity-hash>`.

If there is no content identified by `key`, or if the locally-stored data does
not pass the validity checksum, the promise will be rejected.

A sub-function, `get.byDigest` may be used for identical behavior, except lookup
will happen by integrity hash, bypassing the index entirely. This version of the
function *only* returns `data` itself, without any wrapper.

See: [options](#get-options)

##### Note

This function loads the entire cache entry into memory before returning it. If
you're dealing with Very Large data, consider using [`get.stream`](#get-stream)
instead.

##### Example

```javascript
// Look up
